# Biodiversity-of-an-Ecosystem
## Introduction
Biodiversity is crucial for the health and resilience of ecosystems. In this report, authored by Opeyemi Latona, we delve into the biodiversity of seven taxonomic groups: birds, bees, butterflies, carabids, diptera, homoptera, and hymenoptera. Using descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and linear regression, we explore the levels of biodiversity, changes over time, and relationships with ecological status.

## Method
We conducted exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and linear regression analysis. Descriptive statistics revealed insights into biodiversity levels and data distribution within each taxonomic group. Correlation analysis examined the relationship between biodiversity and geographic coordinates. Hypothesis tests assessed changes over time and differences between biodiversity measures. Linear regression models explored relationships between biodiversity and ecological status.

## Result
The analysis showcased the varying levels of biodiversity across taxonomic groups and identified significant changes over time. Linear regression revealed strong positive relationships between biodiversity and ecological status. The findings provide valuable insights into ecosystem health and inform conservation strategies.

## Conclusion
Understanding biodiversity dynamics is crucial for effective ecosystem management. This analysis highlights key findings regarding biodiversity levels, changes over time, and relationships with ecological status. These insights can guide conservation efforts to preserve biodiversity and promote ecosystem resilience.
